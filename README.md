# AI-Based Test Case Prioritization in CI/CD Pipeline

This project integrates a Machine Learning model into a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
to prioritize test cases before deploying microservices.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Docker
- Jenkins
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Train ML model
2. Predict test failure probability
3. Prioritize tests
4. Execute tests
5. Deploy microservices
